Generate WireGuard configuration files for ProtonVPN from the command line, picking the best server in the countries you ask for. Headless-friendly: log in once, then rotate configs unattended.

## Motivation

I wanted to automatically rotate VPN servers on my private HTPC Linux host running WireGuard, and since I'm already paying for a Proton bundle subscription, why not just use theirs? Unfortunately, as of the time of writing, they didn't have a good programmatic headless way to generate WireGuard profiles, so I did my research and reverse-engineered their APIs (which was a pain in the butt) and created this. The idea is to run this code as a daemon and restart the WireGuard client on profile file change.

## Features

- Username/password login with SRP, including TOTP 2FA
- Session persistence and automatic refresh, so headless runs only need the password once
- Picks the best server using Proton's own Quick Connect metric (lowest `Score`, with `Load` as tiebreaker - lower is better per the official API)
- Filters by country, tier, P2P, and Secure Core, or targets one server by name
- Persistent configurations (visible in the ProtonVPN dashboard) or session-only ones that are never registered on the account
- VPN accelerator, NAT-PMP port forwarding, Moderate NAT, and IPv6
- Lists servers and registered configurations, and renews certificates without generating a new key pair

## Installation

Download a binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/hatemosphere/protonvpn-wg-confgen/releases/latest). Archives are named `protonvpn-wg-confgen_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz` (`.zip` on Windows) and are published with a `checksums.txt` (SHA-256):

```bash
tar xzf protonvpn-wg-confgen_*_linux_amd64.tar.gz
./protonvpn-wg-confgen -h
```

Or build from source (requires Go 1.26+):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hatemosphere/protonvpn-wg-confgen
cd protonvpn-wg-confgen
make build          # produces ./build/protonvpn-wg-confgen
```

`make build` stamps the binary with the current ProtonVPN Linux client version, fetched from upstream at build time. A plain `go build` falls back to the version compiled into `internal/constants`. Advertising an outdated client version gets rejected by the API with code 5003, so prefer `make build`.

You will need a ProtonVPN account; a free one works, with the tier caveats noted below.

## Usage

```bash
protonvpn-wg-confgen -username <username> -countries <country-codes> [options]
protonvpn-wg-confgen -username <username> -server <server-name> [options]
protonvpn-wg-confgen -username <username> -list-servers [-countries <country-codes>]
protonvpn-wg-confgen -username <username> -list-configs
protonvpn-wg-confgen -username <username> -renew-serial <serial-number>
```

`-username` is optional and prompted for when omitted, as is the password. Either `-countries` or `-server` is required when generating a configuration.

### Modes

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| *(default)* | Generate a WireGuard configuration |
| `-list-servers` | List available servers (country, name, city, load, score, tier, features) and exit. Honors `-countries`, `-secure-core`, `-p2p-only`, and `-free-only` |
| `-list-configs` | List persistent configurations on the account (SerialNumber, DeviceName, expiry, key fingerprint) and exit |
| `-renew-serial <serial>` | Renew a persistent certificate by SerialNumber, reusing its existing key. Extends it server-side and writes no `.conf` file |

### Server selection

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-countries` | | Comma-separated country codes, e.g. `US,NL,CH`. Always matches the **exit** country |
| `-server` | | Target one server by name, e.g. `UA#122`. Alternative to `-countries`, and bypasses the filters below |
| `-p2p-only` | `true` | Use only P2P-enabled servers |
| `-secure-core` | `false` | Use only Secure Core servers |
| `-free-only` | `false` | Use only Free tier servers |
| `-debug` | `false` | Print every server that survived filtering |

### Output and network

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-output` | `protonvpn.conf` | Output file path |
| `-device-name` | *(generated)* | Device name shown in the ProtonVPN dashboard |
| `-ipv6` | `false` | Enable IPv6 |
| `-dns` | *(per `-ipv6`)* | Comma-separated DNS servers |
| `-allowed-ips` | *(per `-ipv6`)* | Comma-separated allowed IPs |
| `-accelerator` | `true` | VPN accelerator |
| `-port-forwarding` | `false` | NAT-PMP port forwarding (Plus tier, P2P servers) |
| `-moderate-nat` | `false` | Moderate NAT (paid plans). Cannot be combined with `-port-forwarding` |

### Certificate and session

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-duration` | `365d` (`7d` with `-no-save`) | Certificate lifetime, e.g. `30m`, `24h`, `7d`, `1h30m`. Min `10m`, max `365d` (`7d` with `-no-save`) |
| `-no-save` | `false` | Issue a session-only certificate, never registered on the account |
| `-session-duration` | `0` | Session cache lifetime, e.g. `12h`, `7d`. `0` uses the API expiration. Max `30d` |
| `-clear-session` | `false` | Clear the saved session and re-authenticate |
| `-no-session` | `false` | Disable session persistence entirely |
| `-force-refresh` | `false` | Refresh the session even if it is not expiring soon |
| `-hv-token` | | Human verification token replayed after solving a CAPTCHA out of band, see below |
| `-api-url` | `https://vpn-api.proton.me` | ProtonVPN API base URL |

## Examples

```bash
# Best P2P server across the US and Netherlands
protonvpn-wg-confgen -username myusername -countries US,NL

# Custom DNS and output path
protonvpn-wg-confgen -username myusername -countries CH,DE -dns 1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8 -output switzerland.conf

# A specific server, IPv6 enabled
protonvpn-wg-confgen -username myusername -server UA#122 -ipv6

# Secure Core, 30-day certificate
protonvpn-wg-confgen -username myusername -countries NL,US -secure-core -duration 30d

# Session-only config that never lands in the dashboard
protonvpn-wg-confgen -username myusername -countries US -no-save

# Port forwarding for P2P, or Moderate NAT for gaming (mutually exclusive)
protonvpn-wg-confgen -username myusername -countries NL -port-forwarding
protonvpn-wg-confgen -username myusername -countries NL -moderate-nat

# Free tier only, no session saved to disk
protonvpn-wg-confgen -username myusername -countries US,NL -free-only -no-session
```

Listing and maintenance:

```bash
protonvpn-wg-confgen -username myusername -list-servers -countries US,PL
protonvpn-wg-confgen -username myusername -list-servers -secure-core
protonvpn-wg-confgen -username myusername -list-configs
protonvpn-wg-confgen -username myusername -renew-serial "SERIAL12345"
```

## Persistent vs session-only configurations

Proton issues certificates in one of two modes.

**Persistent** (the default) registers a named configuration on your account. It appears in the ProtonVPN dashboard, is listed by `-list-configs`, can be renewed with `-renew-serial`, and accepts durations up to 365 days.

**Session-only** (`-no-save`) omits `Mode` and `DeviceName` from the request, which is what the official ProtonVPN clients do for an ordinary connection. The `.conf` file is written normally; only the account-side registration is skipped. Consequences:

- Absent from the dashboard and from `-list-configs`, which queries `Mode=persistent` only
- Cannot be renewed - generate a new configuration instead
- `-device-name` is ignored
- Capped at 7 days, which is also the default when `-duration` is omitted. Anything between `10m` and `7d` is honored exactly; longer values are rejected up front, because the API would otherwise silently clamp them to 7 days

Either way, the output reports what was actually issued and the expiry the API granted:

```
Certificate: session, expires 2026-08-05 11:13 UTC
```

### Revoking

Revoking is only possible through the [ProtonVPN web dashboard](https://account.proton.me/u/0/vpn/WireGuard). The API gates `DELETE /vpn/v1/certificate` behind the `full` session scope, which is granted to `account.proton.me` web and desktop logins but not to VPN API clients. Session-only certificates never appear there at all, so they can only be left to expire.

## Server tiers

Free tier servers are excluded unless you ask for them:

| Tier | Selected when | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Free (0) | `-free-only` | Limited selection, higher load, no P2P |
| Plus (2) | default | Full features, including P2P and Secure Core |
| Visionary (3) | default | Returned by the API for historical and bundle plans |

`-free-only` swaps the tier filter rather than widening it: it selects Free servers *exclusively*. It also disables P2P filtering, since Free servers do not support P2P.

## Secure Core

Secure Core routes traffic through a server in a privacy-friendly country before it exits in your chosen one, which protects against network-based attacks at the exit at the cost of latency.

- Entry countries are always Switzerland (CH), Iceland (IS), or Sweden (SE)
- `-countries` filters the **exit** country - where your traffic appears to come from
- Server names carry both ends, so `IS-NL#1` is Iceland -> Netherlands
- P2P filtering is disabled automatically, since Secure Core servers do not support P2P
- Requires a Plus or higher subscription

## IPv6

Configurations are IPv4-only by default. `-ipv6` additionally assigns the IPv6 interface address `2a07:b944::2:2/128`, adds Proton's internal IPv6 DNS `2a07:b944::2:1`, and routes `::/0`. Explicit `-dns` and `-allowed-ips` override these defaults.

## Authentication

This tool requires an account in [single password mode](https://proton.me/support/single-password), the default for new Proton accounts. Legacy 2-password accounts (separate login and mailbox passwords) must switch first.

**2FA is TOTP-only.** Authenticator apps work; FIDO2/WebAuthn security keys do not, because they need browser or platform APIs for the challenge-response protocol. If a security key is your only second factor, either add TOTP in your [account security settings](https://account.proton.me/u/0/vpn/account-password) or use a key that also does TOTP, such as a YubiKey with Yubico Authenticator.

### CAPTCHA (error 9001)

Proton challenges logins it considers automated, most often from datacenter/VPS
addresses or a machine already connected to a VPN. This is not specific to this
tool - the official clients hit the same challenge and solve it in an embedded
webview.

The challenge cannot be solved in a terminal, but it can be solved in a browser
and the result replayed with `-hv-token`. This flow is confirmed working.

On a 9001 the error prints the exact URL to open. The token to replay is **not**
the one in that URL: the widget emits `<challenge>:<solved-response>`, and that
whole colon-joined string is what the API accepts.

1. Open the URL from the error, `<api-url>/core/v4/captcha?Token=<challenge>`
2. Paste this in the browser console **before** solving. The page emits its
   result as a `postMessage`, and browser extensions post plenty of their own,
   so filter for Proton's:

   ```js
   window.addEventListener("message", e => {
     const t = e.data?.type
     if (t === "pm_captcha" || t === "proton_captcha")
       console.log("HV TOKEN:", e.data.token)
   })
   ```

3. Solve the CAPTCHA. The logged token looks like `zB2tiSsS...:RoIAZ83v...`
4. Re-run with the whole string, quoted - the response can contain `/`:

```bash
protonvpn-wg-confgen -username myusername -countries US -hv-token '<challenge>:<response>'
```

Challenge tokens expire, so if step 4 reports 9001 again, restart from the fresh
token in the new error.

The token travels as `x-pm-human-verification-token`, matching Proton's own
client. Only the `captcha` method is replayable this way; `email` and `sms`
deliver a code through a separate flow. Signing in once at account.proton.me
from the same network, or retrying from a residential connection, may also clear
the challenge.

### Session persistence

Sessions are stored in `~/.protonvpn-session.json` with `0600` permissions, verified before reuse, and tied to the username that created them.

- Proton sessions expire after 30 days (the API's `ExpiresIn`)
- `-session-duration` shortens that; values beyond the API's expiration are capped to it
- Sessions refresh automatically when fewer than 7 days remain
- `-clear-session`, `-force-refresh`, and `-no-session` override the defaults

## Using the generated configuration

On Linux and macOS:

```bash
sudo wg-quick up ./protonvpn.conf
```

On Windows or any GUI client, import the file.

## Security notes

- A fresh WireGuard keypair is generated on every run, except with `-renew-serial`, which reuses the existing key
- Configuration files hold your private key and are written with `0600` permissions - never share them
- Persistent configurations can be revoked from the dashboard; session-only ones cannot be revoked at all and simply expire within 7 days
